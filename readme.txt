In the Payroll Management System project, tables were created using SQL commands to store information related to employee attendance, departments, employee details, allowances, deductions, and payroll. The attendance table was populated with values representing the attendance of employees for a given period. Similarly, the department table stored information about different departments within the organization.

The employee table stored details about each employee, including their name, ID, salary, and department. The employee allowances and deductions tables stored information about the various allowances and deductions that were applied to each employee's salary.

Finally, the payroll table stored the calculated salary information for each employee, taking into account the values stored in the other tables. The database was designed to be flexible, allowing for the easy addition or modification of tables as needed.

Throughout the project, SQL commands were used to alter the structure of the tables to accommodate changes in requirements or data. This allowed for a flexible and adaptable database that could easily be updated as needed. The end result was a functional Payroll Management System that was able to efficiently store, calculate, and retrieve salary information for all employees in the organization.
