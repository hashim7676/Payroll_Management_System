# Payroll_Management_System
The Payroll Management System project is a comprehensive database designed to efficiently manage employee attendance, departmental information, employee details, allowances, deductions, and payroll. SQL commands were used to create and populate the various tables, ensuring that all necessary information was stored in a structured and organized manner.

The database was designed to be flexible, allowing for the easy addition or modification of tables as needed. This ensured that the system remained adaptable and could accommodate changes in requirements or data without difficulty.

The system was carefully developed to provide accurate and timely payroll information for all employees. By utilizing the employee attendance, department, employee details, allowances, and deductions tables, the system was able to calculate payroll information for each employee, storing the results in the payroll table.

Throughout the project, SQL commands were used to modify the structure of the tables, ensuring that the system remained up-to-date and functional. The end result was a powerful and efficient Payroll Management System that was able to accurately store, calculate, and retrieve salary information for all employees within the organization.
